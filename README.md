# Discord-bot
Still working on it, discord bot made in discord.py, I plan on making a way to easily "copy" and run the bot so that theres no code to touch, for now its only
able to play music off of youtube using yt_dl fork yt_dlp.
(Note: ignore token variable in .env file since it's been used for tests and it's not going to work)
